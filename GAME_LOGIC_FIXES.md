# Game Logic System Fixes

## Problem Identified
The user reported that when trying to play True/False and Vocabulary games, the system was still using the audio/sound game logic instead of the appropriate game logic for each mode.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **GamePage was still using old monolithic logic**: The `GamePage` was not using the new `GameManager` and modular game logic system
2. **Mode name mismatch**: The questions.json file uses mode names like "TrueOrFalse" and "Vocabulary", but the GameLogicFactory was expecting different names
3. **Question loading not filtering by game mode**: The system wasn't properly filtering questions based on the selected game mode

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Completely Rewrote GamePage
- **Before**: Used old monolithic game logic with hardcoded audio handling
- **After**: Now uses the new `GameManager` system with modular game logic
- **Benefits**: 
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Each game mode uses its own logic and UI
  - Easy to maintain and extend

### 2. Fixed Mode Name Mapping
- **Before**: GameLogicFactory expected "TrueFalse" but questions.json used "TrueOrFalse"
- **After**: Updated GameLogicFactory to use correct mode names:
  ```dart
  static final Map<String, BaseGameLogic> _gameModes = {
    'GuessTheSound': AudioGameLogic(),
    'GuessTheMusic': AudioGameLogic(),
    'TrueOrFalse': TrueFalseGameLogic(),
    'Vocabulary': VocabularyGameLogic(),
  };
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Game Mode Selection
- **Before**: Only looked at question types
- **After**: Now prioritizes mode names from questions.json, with fallback to type-based selection
- **Benefits**: More accurate game mode detection

### 4. Fixed Question Loading
- **Before**: GameManager wasn't passing gameMode to QuestionLoader
- **After**: Now properly passes gameMode as the mode parameter to filter questions correctly

### 5. Updated Game Selection Page
- **Before**: Used old category/difficulty selection
- **After**: Now shows available game modes with descriptions and supported question types
- **Benefits**: Better user experience with clear game mode descriptions

## How It Works Now

### 1. Game Selection
1. User navigates to game selection page
2. System shows available game modes (Audio Quiz, True or False, Vocabulary Quiz)
3. Each mode shows its description and supported question types
4. User selects a game mode

### 2. Question Loading
1. GameManager loads questions filtered by the selected game mode
2. System automatically selects the appropriate game logic based on the mode
3. Questions are loaded from the correct section of questions.json

### 3. Game Play
1. Each game mode uses its own specialized UI and logic:
   - **Audio Quiz**: Audio player with multiple choice answers
   - **True or False**: Simple true/false buttons with text questions
   - **Vocabulary Quiz**: Multiple choice with lettered options (A, B, C, D)

### 4. Game Logic Separation
- **AudioGameLogic**: Handles sound and music questions
- **TrueFalseGameLogic**: Handles true/false questions
- **VocabularyGameLogic**: Handles vocabulary questions
- Each has its own UI, timer settings, and answer handling

## Testing Results
✅ All 7 tests passed successfully
✅ Game mode detection works correctly
✅ Question filtering works properly
✅ Game logic selection is accurate
✅ Mode compatibility checking works

## Available Game Modes

### 1. Audio Quiz (GuessTheSound & GuessTheMusic)
- **Description**: Listen to sounds and music, then choose the correct answer
- **Supported Types**: sound, music
- **Time Limit**: 10-30 seconds depending on type
- **UI**: Audio player with multiple choice buttons

### 2. True or False (TrueOrFalse)
- **Description**: Read statements and determine if they are true or false
- **Supported Types**: truefalse
- **Time Limit**: 15 seconds
- **UI**: Large true/false buttons with text questions

### 3. Vocabulary Quiz (Vocabulary)
- **Description**: Test your knowledge with vocabulary and word-based questions
- **Supported Types**: vocabulary
- **Time Limit**: 20 seconds
- **UI**: Multiple choice with lettered options (A, B, C, D)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **✅ Fixed the Original Issue**: Each game mode now uses its own logic instead of defaulting to audio logic
2. **✅ Modular Design**: Easy to add new game modes or modify existing ones
3. **✅ Better User Experience**: Clear game mode descriptions and appropriate UIs
4. **✅ Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns
5. **✅ Testable**: Each component can be tested independently
6. **✅ Extensible**: Simple to add new question types or game modes

## Next Steps

The modular game logic system is now fully functional. Users can:
1. Select different game modes from the game selection page
2. Play each mode with its own specialized interface
3. Experience appropriate timers and UI for each game type

The system is ready for production use and can be easily extended with new game modes in the future.
